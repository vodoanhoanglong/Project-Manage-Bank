<h1>FlexGantt for Java Swing</h1>

(please note that a JavaFX version of FlexGantt is also available at dlsc.com).

<h2>Welcome</h2>
thank you for downloading and evaluating FlexGantt, the most advanced Gantt
chart user interface component for planning and scheduling applications written 
in Java. FlexGantt is based on the Swing framework from Sun Microsystems / Oracle
and adheres to its design principles. It extends these principles with a powerful
policy implementation and command framework that is used to control the behaviour 
of the Gantt chart.<br>
<br>
FlexGantt's main features are:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Model-View-Controller</li>
	<li>Interactive</li>
	<li>Completely customizable appearance (renderers)</li>
	<li>Completely customizable editing (editors)</li>
	<li>Built-in printing</li>
	<li>Layers (alpha channel, transparency)</li>
	<li>Lazy loading of tree nodes and timeline objects</li>
	<li>Built-in command framework (undo / redo functionality)</li>
	<li>Paging (e.g. quickly switch from one year to another)</li>
	<li>Variable row heights</li>
	<li>Multi-column sorting</li>
	<li>Pluggable dateline models (show standard time or time units or ...)</li>
	<li>Printing</li>
</ul>
<br>
To see these features in action, please try out the demo applications located in the
"demos" folder:

<ul>
	<li>examples-demo.jar: a "showcase" application with several standalone demos highlighting different aspects of the framework.</li>
	<li>emirates-demo.jar: a proof of concept application developed for Emirates Airlines.</li>
	<li>msproject-demo.jar: an application based on FlexGantt and the MPXJ open source project to load and display MSProject files.</li>
</ul>

The demos can be launched on the command line like this: "java -jar examples-demo.jar".
     
<h2>Source Code Examples</h2>
    Example files can be found in the demo application under the "Sources" tab.

<h2>Getting Started / Tutorial</h2>
    A small "tutorial" can be found in the folder with the same name. Take a
    look at the README file and compile and run the different steps according

    to get you started on creating your first Gantt chart. Please consult the
